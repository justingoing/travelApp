Inspection/Code Review

defaultSVG - are we still using this? it is returned in our plan API, which is making our server not interoperable. 

Line 59 - shouldn't optimization be >= .75 not .7

Line 101 - "sent to the server" should be sent to client
Line 345 "conver" -> convert

Line 119 - add comment as to what this means
    as well as the if else statement, (means draw off screen left/right?)
    
copyTFFI turns into nextTFFI where? 
    has coords (for GoogleMap?), defaultSVG
    
getMappedCoords - remove transX and transY as worldSVG requires no translating

line 218/219 remove comments 231/232 also

Clean all print statements in validateLatLong

defaultSVG is very long line on 33 <!-- > isn't this a javascript comment or does it effect defaultSVG, if we even need it.
    Shouldn't defaultSVG be set in another attribute of the json sent back, not its own?
