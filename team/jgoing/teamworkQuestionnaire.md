# Teamwork Questionnaire for Justin Going

1. __What is your personality type?__
   * ESFJ
1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * I really dont have a method of preferred contact. I setup notifications for slack on my phone so I'll see everything!
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * To work together as a cohesive unit and crush whatever task comes our way. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I used to work in groups all the time in the military and really enjoy the comradery and joy that comes from successful
     team work. So getting to the phase of being a happy and successful team is my goal. 
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I think coordination of schedules will be the hardest part. It will require a lot of planning and open communication. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * We try our hardest to keep that person motivated to put their best foot forward and remind them we are in it together. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Only if that person wants to go above and beyond themselves. Nothing else should be expected outside of how we break apart
     tasks as a team. We should set expectations as a team, and all meet them. 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * As much as it takes. 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * A group discussion of what needs to be done and the best way to evenly distribute the work to play to eachothers strengths.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Hopefully that shortcoming will be communicated before the deadline and we can work together to pick up the slack.
     Otherwise we just suffer the consequences together. 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * That differing opinion should be expressed to the group, discussed amongst us, and find the best way to move forward that
     all are happy with. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Different work habits are to be expected. But it should not hinder the work of otherwise. Plans should be generated to
     strike a balance between us. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I think it would be best to have times in the lab where we all work together. It makes things much easier.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * If in the lab, several times a week. It just to meetup and plan. Maybe once a week. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Decisions should be made as a team. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Ensure that persone is heard, and every option to make them happy with the direction of the project is explored and communicated.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * It doesnt become a problem unless it hinders the teams ability to propose and explore the best ideas. Then remind that 
     person that we need to communicate and progress as an equal team. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Express that opinion in a professional manner. Productive and professional communication about all things is key to success.
