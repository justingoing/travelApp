# Teamwork Questionnaire for Samuel Kaessner

1. __What is your personality type?__
   ISFP
   
1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   Text Message (303-718-4161) or Slack.
   
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   I expect we will create software is high-quality, and that we will strive to get an A on the project. 
   
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   I'd like to get my work done early so that the team has time to review my code, and then I can edit the code if necessary. 
   
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   Different expectations, different levels of knowledge, different schedules.
   
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   We will need to come to a consensus on that, so that everyone is on the same page and has the same standards.
   
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   Yes.
   
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   10hrs/week.
   
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   Team meetings. 
  
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   It happens, so the first couple of times are not a problem, but if it becomes a chronic issue, then address it by talking to them first.
   
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   Make sure we all agree on the quality of work, and if we can't come to an agreement, explicitly state which parts of the code correspond to which person. 
   
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
  Set clear expectations on deadlines and work accomplished. Then, each member can have their own work habits but there is accountability for results.

1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   Yes. Wednesday during the day would be best for me.
   
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   3-5 hours a week. 
   
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   No, majority rules, but the extent of the decision plays a part in how much consensus we need. (Bigger decisions need more approval).
   
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   Try to work out an agreeable solution for everyone, but if we cannot agree, continue with majority vote. 
   
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   Talk to them first if they seem like they are dominating the direction of the project. If they continue after that, then talk to Dave if the rest of the team agrees they are causing issues.
   
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   Communicate this clearly, and get the load re-balanced.
