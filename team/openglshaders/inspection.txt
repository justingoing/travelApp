We should separate the SVG rendering out. 


Plan is odd. We send back an error if lat/lon are invalid, but simply remove places if we get a NPE. 


3opt should be anytime optimization is above .75, not .7

We always return an error, regardless of whether or not we got an error. 


Not sure how this works    String read = "", cur;
 

getMappedCoords: variable scaleX and scaleY are redundant.

We have a lot of commented out code that should be removed. 

svg: we load in the colorado svg but never use it.

Validate lat/lon should be merged with convertToDecimal
