## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (kiwis.cs.colostate.edu).

* Product Increment release `v4.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the Release Notes template, and the archived files.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>4.0</version>`.
* Javadoc and unit tests for public methods.

## Policies

* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests pull requests for master branch always.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* Filtered Searches
* Zoom and Pan the map
* Distance Unit Configuration
* Branding
* Plan Trips outside of Colorado
* System Testing

We missed our milestone slightly from last time, so we bit off
a bit less this time, especially since we have less time. 
Additionally, we are going to try to be more realistic with our 
estimations, since last time a lot of the tasks were underestimated.
